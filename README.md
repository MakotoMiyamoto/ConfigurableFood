# ConfigurableFood
ConfigurableFood v1.0 allows you to create food which gives the player a defined amount of saturation and health on consumption, as defined by the server developer.

All foods not defined (by name and lore) in the Foods list will not be affected by the plugin, and thus keep their vanilla properties.

TODO:

Command support:

  enable and disable command ingame with /cftoggle
  
  get a custom food with /cfgive <name>
